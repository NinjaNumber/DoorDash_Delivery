# DoorDash_Delivery
Predicting delivery time

The goal of this notebook is to predict the total delivery time starting when an order is placed on DoorDash app until it is delivered to the customer. This problem is solved in 4 sections.
**1. Data Preparation**
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering

**2. Collinearity and removing redundancies**
- Examining heatmap & remove pairs with high correlations

**3. Multicollinearity and feature selection**
- IVF method
- Gini's importance
- PCA

**4. Machine Learning models**
- Applied 6 different regression algorithms on 4 different feature sets with 3 different scalers, so we got 72 results. 
- Reframed the problem by changing the predictors and predicted values.
